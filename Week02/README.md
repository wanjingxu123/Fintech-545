# Week02_Report README

This report involves statistical packages offered by Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. 
The libraries used for this report are:
pandas: data manipulation and analysis (read csv file and calculate descriptive statistics)
numpy: numerical operations and array handling (covariance matrix)
scipy.stats: run statistical tests
matplotlib.pyplot: creating plots (e.g. question2c)
statsmodels: statistical models and tests
seaborn: for data plot color patterns and themes
ARIMA from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model: time series analysis and modeling (e.g. question3 AR and MA models)

Running code steps:
1. ensure that Python, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries are installed
2. open Jupyter Notebook and run each cell from top to bottom. Markdown cells contain question titles, while code blocks include the corresponding code and comments.
